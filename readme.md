# Using Discord on the Blackberry Bold 9900

All credit goes to [gtrxAC](https://github.com/gtrxAC/discord-j2me?tab=readme-ov-file) for developing this app. I am demonstrating how to use it on the Bold 9900. 

Important Information:

- I reccomend you use a burner discord account because all traffic is unencrypted and the owner of the service can see everything you send. In addition, Discord might ban your account for using this service.

- The app will crash if you open a DM/server that has no messages.

## 1. Installation

1. Connect your Bold to the internet via a wifi connection.

2. Visit http://149.59.80.3/discord_midp2.jad on your Bold.

3. Install the file from the downloads menu.

## 2. Setup

1. Obtain the user token for a **burner** discord account. Find out how [here.](https://www.howtogeek.com/879956/what-is-a-discord-token-and-how-do-you-get-one/) Read why below.

2. Open the Discord app on your Bold.

3. Manually type the user token into the Discord app.

4. Press the BlackBerry key above the QWERTY keyboard to open the context menu. Then, select "Log In"



## 3. Your First Message

1. Ensure that your Bold only accesses discord servers which already have messages. Otherwise the app will crash. 

2. Once ready to write a message, Open your desired location in the discord app and press the blackberry key to open the context menu. Then, select to type a message and do the same to send it. 

3. You can also reply to messages and perform relatively advanced functions with this app, including sending media!
